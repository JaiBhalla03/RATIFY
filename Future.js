      Ratify is basically a B2B platform which mainly aims at getting its revenue from these
small-scale business owner who will be charged for a monthly/yearly subscription for
using the website.
The users of Ratify will be these business owners who wants to grow their business but
dont have enough resources to do so.
The people surfing through the website and giving the reviews and ratings on it will be
the ones who want to buy a service or product from these companies and are
curious about the quality of the products. 40 percent of our profits would be distributed among NGOs.
